EasyDrafter is a web app created by Allison Craig which is used to create clothing pattern blocks for DIY enthusiasts.
In traditional clothing patternmaking, drafting blocks can take a lot of time and have human error. My app makes it quick and easy to make a block so the pattern drafter can get to making more complex patterns quicker.

## <a name="drafting"></a>Drafting on an (X,Y) Axis
HTML5 Canvas was used to draft my pattern blocks. They use a system of (x,y) axis on a grid that starts at (0,0) at the top left corner. 


## <a name="math"></a>Calculating The Block
The main component of this app is the pattern drafting algorithms which were created to mimic traditional pattern drafting techniques using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.
I created many functions to specialy help me calculate the axis of a specific coordinate. Many of my functions are based on the geometry of right triangles.
