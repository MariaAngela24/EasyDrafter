# Pattern Pro
Pattern Pro is a wed app created by Allison Craig which is used to create clothing pattern blocks for tailors and seamstresses.
In traditional clothing patternmaking, drafting blocks can take a lot of time and have human error. My app makes it quick and easy to make a block so the pattern drafter can get to making more complex patterns quicker.
